    <p>
      Google and its subsidiary YouTube guarantee that they will follow the EU&#39;s data protection
      regulations when processing data in the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use YouTube in its advanced privacy mode to show you videos. The legal basis is Art. 6
      Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in improving the quality of our website.
      According to YouTube, the advanced privacy mode means that the data specified below will only
      be transmitted to the YouTube server if you actually start a video.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without this mode, a connection to the YouTube server in the USA will be established as soon
      as you access any of our webpages on which a YouTube video is embedded.
    </p>
    <p>
      This connection is required in order to be able to display the respective video on our website
      within your browser. YouTube will record and process at a minimum your IP address, the date
      and time the video was displayed, as well as the website you visited. In addition, a
      connection to the DoubleClick advertising network of Google is established.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are logged in to YouTube when you access our site, YouTube will assign the connection
      information to your YouTube account. To prevent this, you must either log out of YouTube
      before visiting our site or make the appropriate settings in your YouTube account.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the purpose of functionality and analysis of usage behavior, YouTube permanently stores
      cookies on your device via your browser. If you do not agree to this processing, you have the
      option of preventing the installation of cookies by making the appropriate settings in your
      browser. Further details can be found in the section about cookies above.
